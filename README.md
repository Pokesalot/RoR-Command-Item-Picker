# RoR-Command-Item-Picker
Picks your items when using Command in Risk of Rain 2!

Are you tired of having to menu, and use the brain muscle when all you really want to do is sit back, use the Command artifact, and get a broken build that gets stolen by Mithrix phase 4? Look no further! This repo will allow you to run a script in the background that will let you preselect your build (or have one preselected for you) and will automatically click items for you while you play Risk of Rain. 

This is not a mod, and will not tamper with game files. All code is my own, images of items are not.

Required packages:
- pynput: listens for keyboard keystrokes
- python_imagesearch: looks for items on screen to click on
- numpy: might be builtin, array math
